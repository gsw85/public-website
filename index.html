      <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">A visionary and a passionate entrepreneur, Dr Goh Shu Wei is the Chief Operating Officer of Skymind Asia. A backward glimpse into his childhood reflects an upbringing that nurtured his entrepreneurial side.  At the tender age of 5, Dr Goh was put to task to help out at his parents’ coffee shop (local eatery), assisting in the daily operations as a helper until he was 12, thus instilling in him the important values of hard work, determination and perseverance, as had his parents hoped to cultivate. In order to earn extra pocket money, he found employment within the same vicinity as a trainee in an outlet selling computers, picking up the tools of the trade along the way. As he progressed, his self-acquired skills and competence saw him being promoted to a technician, inspecting and repairing computers for customers. Having an inquisitive mind and a knack for learning, his time spent at this computer outlet led him to pick up computer coding as well as other computer applications, including computer graphics. His experience at this computer shop proved beneficial as it was a means for him to earn an income as a graduate student and used as a launchpad for an IT-company which he later co-founded.</p>

<h3>EARLY WORK EXPOSURE</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Being a person with varied interests, for his tertiary education in 2007, Dr Goh chose to major in civil engineering for his Bachelor’s Degree at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan, U.S.A. Shortly thereafter, he completed his Master’s Degree in 2009 and went on to pursue a Doctoral Degree in civil engineering, specializing in Materials and Pavement Design which he completed in 2012. As a means to finance his tertiary education, Dr Goh worked as a Research Assistant and Learning Center Coach at Michigan Technological University. To further supplement his income, Dr Goh delved into his entrepreneurial side by trading gadgets online and reconditioned old computers to have them sold later. He also dabbled in trading securities and currency and after having profited from it, he provided financial advice derived from his experience to other traders at a fee. The extra income was used to pay for his studies and other expenses as a student, which is a testament to his resourcefulness and perseverance.</p>

<h3>SPORTS AND OTHER SKILLS</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. Goh was also very athletic as a young high school student, winning top prizes in badminton and softball. From 1998 to 2002, he was part of the team that won the Perlis State Championship in Softball. In 2002, they also won in the National Open Competition for Softball in Malaysia. Not content with just building his athletic skills, Dr. Goh also focused on other activities that allowed him to use his interests. In 1993, he won third place in a mental arithmetic competition. In 1999, 2001, 2002 and 2004, he also placed first in a watercolor painting contest in Perlis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. Goh’s intellectual capacity was also recognized by MENSA. In 2004, he qualified for membership in the prestigious organization after passing a standardized test. MENSA is the world’s oldest and largest society that consists only of high-IQ members. The non-profit organization is based in Caythorpe, Lincolnshire, England, although it also has local national groups in a number of countries. Members qualify once they have undergone an approved supervised and/or standardized intelligence test and scored a minimum rating at the 98th percentile. MENSA members have included scientists, mathematicians, world-renowned researchers, businessmen and businesswomen, professors and even entertainers.</p>
<h3>EARLY RESEARCH WORK</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr Goh has published over 100 research papers during his PhD study at Michigan Technological University in Houghton and was the first Malaysian to receive the David Eisenhower Fellowship from the USDOT Federal Highway Administration. His research projects have ranged from developing test procedures for specific gravity to evaluating warm-mix asphalt technologies to improving the properties of asphalt with recycled materials. In 2012, Dr Goh founded a company called Universal Pave, a technology-driven engineering, procurement and construction company specializing in the design and construction of transportation infrastructure and heavy civil construction. With his expertise in several asphalt-based technologies, from warm and hot mix asphalt to modified asphalt, nano asphalt, bio-asphalt, recycled asphalt, and sustainable pavement, Universal Pave succeeded in standing out in the industry as having the most updated research and development solutions, to apply cutting-edge technologies and innovative approaches for procuring asphalt materials and providing reliable consulting services to their clients. Through his strategic alliance with the Research Institute of Highway Ministry of Transport of the People’s Republic of China, the company grew to become one of the very few infrastructure companies in the country that have a proven track record in investment, development, construction and management capabilities.</p>
