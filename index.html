      <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">A visionary and a passionate entrepreneur, Dr Goh Shu Wei is the Chief Operating Officer of Skymind Asia. A backward glimpse into his childhood reflects an upbringing that nurtured his entrepreneurial side.  At the tender age of 5, Dr Goh was put to task to help out at his parents’ coffee shop (local eatery), assisting in the daily operations as a helper until he was 12, thus instilling in him the important values of hard work, determination and perseverance, as had his parents hoped to cultivate. In order to earn extra pocket money, he found employment within the same vicinity as a trainee in an outlet selling computers, picking up the tools of the trade along the way. As he progressed, his self-acquired skills and competence saw him being promoted to a technician, inspecting and repairing computers for customers. Having an inquisitive mind and a knack for learning, his time spent at this computer outlet led him to pick up computer coding as well as other computer applications, including computer graphics. His experience at this computer shop proved beneficial as it was a means for him to earn an income as a graduate student and used as a launchpad for an IT-company which he later co-founded.</p>

<h3>EARLY WORK EXPOSURE</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Being a person with varied interests, for his tertiary education in 2007, Dr Goh chose to major in civil engineering for his Bachelor’s Degree at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan, U.S.A. Shortly thereafter, he completed his Master’s Degree in 2009 and went on to pursue a Doctoral Degree in civil engineering, specializing in Materials and Pavement Design which he completed in 2012. As a means to finance his tertiary education, Dr Goh worked as a Research Assistant and Learning Center Coach at Michigan Technological University. To further supplement his income, Dr Goh delved into his entrepreneurial side by trading gadgets online and reconditioned old computers to have them sold later. He also dabbled in trading securities and currency and after having profited from it, he provided financial advice derived from his experience to other traders at a fee. The extra income was used to pay for his studies and other expenses as a student, which is a testament to his resourcefulness and perseverance.</p>

The extra income he earned was used to pay for his studies and other expenses as a student.</li>
</ul>

<h3>EARLY RESEARCH WORK</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">During his senior year as a civil engineering student, Dr. Goh submitted a proposal for a study of the sustainable development of transportation materials. The project proposed the integration of Warm Mix technology into the HMA or Hot Mix Asphalt process. After being reviewed, his proposal was accepted by the Civil Engineering Department of the Michigan Tech. University. Dr. Goh also published five papers during his last semesters. His papers were published by the International Journal of Pavement Research and Technology, the Journal of Transportation Material and the Journal of Geotechnical Engineering.</p>
