MENSA members have included scientists, mathematicians, world-renowned researchers, businessmen and businesswomen, professors and even entertainers.</p>
<h3>EARLY CAREER</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Although multi-skilled and multi-talented, Dr. Goh chose to focus on civil engineering as a career. In 2007, he enrolled for classes at the Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan, U.S.A. Shortly thereafter, he completed his Master’s degree in 2009. He also pursued a Doctoral Degree in civil engineering specializing in Materials and Pavement Design that he completed in 2012. To finance his education, Dr. Goh worked a number of jobs in different locations to earn extra income. Some of the jobs he held included:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Research Assistant at the Michigan Tech. University</strong> – Dr. Goh’s job involved evaluating different types of asphalt mixtures and binders using the AMPT or Asphalt Mixture Performance Tester and the Superpave binder test. He worked with warm mix asphalt, recycled asphalt shingles, bottom ash-based asphalt mixture, recycled asphalt pavement and nano-modified asphalt.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Learning Center Coach at the Michigan Tech. University</strong> – As a Learning Center coach, Dr. Goh provided assistance to other students studying civil engineering. He provided input and guidance for students who needed guidance as part of their studies. For his work, Dr. Goh received the Excellence Coach Award.</li>
