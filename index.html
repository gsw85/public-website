Not content with just building his athletic skills, Dr. Goh also focused on other activities that allowed him to use his interests. In 1993, he won third place in a mental arithmetic competition. In 1999, 2001, 2002 and 2004, he also placed first in a watercolor painting contest in Perlis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. Goh’s intellectual capacity was also recognized by MENSA. In 2004, he qualified for membership in the prestigious organization after passing a standardized test. MENSA is the world’s oldest and largest society that consists only of high-IQ members. The non-profit organization is based in Caythorpe, Lincolnshire, England, although it also has local national groups in a number of countries. Members qualify once they have undergone an approved supervised and/or standardized intelligence test and scored a minimum rating at the 98th percentile. MENSA members have included scientists, mathematicians, world-renowned researchers, businessmen and businesswomen, professors and even entertainers.</p>
<h3>EARLY CAREER</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Although multi-skilled and multi-talented, Dr. Goh chose to focus on civil engineering as a career. In 2007, he enrolled for classes at the Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan, U.S.A. Shortly thereafter, he completed his Master’s degree in 2009. He also pursued a Doctoral Degree in civil engineering specializing in Materials and Pavement Design that he completed in 2012. To finance his education, Dr. Goh worked a number of jobs in different locations to earn extra income. Some of the jobs he held included:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Research Assistant at the Michigan Tech. University</strong> – Dr. Goh’s job involved evaluating different types of asphalt mixtures and binders using the AMPT or Asphalt Mixture Performance Tester and the Superpave binder test. He worked with warm mix asphalt, recycled asphalt shingles, bottom ash-based asphalt mixture, recycled asphalt pavement and nano-modified asphalt.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Learning Center Coach at the Michigan Tech. University</strong> – As a Learning Center coach, Dr. Goh provided assistance to other students studying civil engineering. He provided input and guidance for students who needed guidance as part of their studies. For his work, Dr. Goh received the Excellence Coach Award.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Graphic Design</strong>- During his stint working as a technician at a computer shop, Dr. Goh picked up computer graphic skills and used them to earn extra income working for his department.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Watercolor Painting</strong> – Having dabbled in watercolor painting at a young age and earned prizes for his efforts, Dr. Goh also sold paintings to earn money for college.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sales and Trading</strong> – Dr. Goh explored his entrepreneurial bent during his studies by buying and selling gadgets online. He also repaired computers and resold them to earn an income on the side. He also earned by trading securities and currency. Once he learned the ropes and developed the right knowledge, he also provided advice for other traders, for which he was paid. The extra income he earned was used to pay for his studies and other expenses as a student.</li>
</ul>

<h3>EARLY RESEARCH WORK</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">During his senior year as a civil engineering student, Dr. Goh submitted a proposal for a study of the sustainable development of transportation materials. The project proposed the integration of Warm Mix technology into the HMA or Hot Mix Asphalt process. After being reviewed, his proposal was accepted by the Civil Engineering Department of the Michigan Tech. University. Dr. Goh also published five papers during his last semesters. His papers were published by the International Journal of Pavement Research and Technology, the Journal of Transportation Material and the Journal of Geotechnical Engineering.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In addition to his exemplary performance as a student, Dr. Goh also earned numerous awards and recognitions. In 2007, he qualified as Ordinary Member for Malaysia’s Road Engineering Association. In the same year, he also qualified as scholar for MTU’s Sustainable Future Program and was nominated for exemplary leadership under the President’s Award program. He also completed the NCAT or National Center of Asphalt Technology and the NAPA or National Asphalt Pavement Association professional training as a fully-funded scholar in 2007.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. Goh also received funding to study in Finland and a scholarship with CSX, one of the leading rail companies in the U.S.A. In 2008, he became the first Malaysian to receive the Federal Highway Administration USDOT David Eisenhower Fellowship in 2008. From 2007 to 2009, he was also a Summer scholar at the University of Transportation Center at MTU. In 2009, he earned credits to qualify as a member of the National Scholar Honor Society. While earning his PhD, Dr. Goh also acted as an adviser for the MTU Pavement Enterprise.</p>      

<h3>EARLY PROJECTS</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">During his term as a Masters and Doctorate student, Dr. Goh was involved in a number of projects in his specialty. From 2006 to 2011, he participated in projects sponsored by the Michigan Department of Transportation and the U.S. National Science Foundation. These projects included:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify">Development of New Test Procedures for Measuring Fine and Coarse Aggregate Specific Gravity (completed in 2008)</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify">Development of Specifications for Superpave Simple Performance Test (completed in 2009)</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify">Laboratory Evaluation of Warm Mix Asphalt (completed in 2010)</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify">Collaboration Research – Micro-mechanics of Cubic Stone Materials Used for Pavement (completed in 2011)</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify">Alternative Materials for Sustainable Transportation (completed in 2012)</li>

</ul>      
<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. Goh’s specialty areas are Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) and Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA). Both HMA and WMA technologies are considered to be significant driving forces in the transportation industry due to their lower demand on energy. WMA is also expected to contribute in decreasing consumption of fuel, reducing emission, reducing binder aging and allowing traffic to open early as a result. Dr. Goh has researched intensively in the development of Warm Mix Asphalt technology and is considered as one of the leading researchers in the field. As a doctorate student, he was a speaker at a number of conferences, seminars and research forums. He has presented at the Michigan Technological University graduate school for the Research Colloquium and the Student Council, the REAAA Conference, Caterpillar Inc. in Peori, Illinois, the American Society of Civil Engineering Conferences, the Cold Region Engineering Conference, the International Conference on the Bearing Capacity of Roads, Railways and Airfield and the Selia Group in Johor, Malaysia, among others.</p>
